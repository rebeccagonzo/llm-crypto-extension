# LLM Crypto Extension: Interactive Analytics Dashboard (In Progress)
🚧 Ongoing Extension 🚧

This repository is an independent extension of a collaborative academic project exploring the use of LLMs in cryptographic reasoning and problem-solving tasks.
This extension aims to:
 - Transform static benchmark results into an interactive dashboard
 - Improve interpretability and comparative analysis of model performance
- Enhance data storytelling and visualization design
- Provide a more intuitive exploration layer for LLM-based crypto signals

Development is ongoing!

# Original Academic Benchmark (Fall 2025)
Benchmarking framework for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) on cryptography-related reasoning and problem-solving tasks.

## Project Overview

This repository provides a unified environment for evaluating multiple LLMs (Gemini, LLaMA, Mixtral, GPT-OSS-20B, etc.) across three standardized cryptography datasets:

CipherBench — Instruction-following cipher puzzles requiring strict one-line outputs.

CipherBank — Classical cipher decryption tasks (Caesar, Atbash, Vigenère, and others).

CyberMetric — Multiple-choice cybersecurity and privacy questions.

Each dataset is processed through adapter modules, evaluated through a shared modeling interface, and scored with consistent, transparent metrics.

## Functionality Overview

This project implements a full benchmarking pipeline for evaluating multiple LLMs on cryptography-focused datasets. Below is a clear breakdown of what works and what was not included in our final version.

### Fully Working

- Unified evaluation pipeline across all three datasets (CipherBench, CipherBank, CyberMetric)
- Model interface that supports:
  - Google Gemini API
  - LLaMA 3.3 via OpenRouter
  - Mistral 7B via OpenRouter
  - GPT-OSS-20B via OpenRouter
- CSV output and results folder for storing evaluation runs
- Ability to run any model + dataset combination through a single Jupyter Notebook

### Not Implemented
- Unable to run the original **AICrypto datasets** against LLMs

### Foundational Prior Work

**AI-Crypto: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Cryptography Capabilities of Large Language Models** (2024).  
*arXiv preprint.* https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09580

This paper presents the first thorough benchmark assessing the cryptographic capabilities of large language models. AI-Crypto provides the conceptual foundation for our work and motivates the datasets and evaluation strategies used within this project.

### Contemporary Related Work Extending the Area

**CipherBench: When “Competency” in Reasoning Opens the Door to Vulnerability: Jailbreaking LLMs via Novel Ciphers** (2025).  
*arXiv preprint.* https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10601

CipherBench evaluates LLM accuracy in decrypting classical ciphers and highlights vulnerabilities that arise from inconsistent reasoning behaviors. Our project builds on this direction by evaluating multiple models across CipherBench and two additional datasets (CipherBank and CyberMetric), positioning our results within the progression of LLM cryptographic research.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<username>/LLM-CRYPTO-BENCH.git
cd LLM-CRYPTO-BENCH
```
2. Set your remote with your username
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>@github.com/jzarazua505/LLM-CRYPTO-BENCH.git
```
3. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)

GitHub passwords do NOT work for pushing.

- Go to: https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens
- Generate a Fine-grained token
- Give it access to the LLM-CRYPTO-BENCH repo
- Permissions:
  - Contents → Read and write
  - Metadata → Read-only
- Copy the token (you won’t see it again)
4. Install Python 3.11.10 (Required)

This project must be run using Python 3.11.10.

Using Python 3.12+ will cause errors with the Gemini SDK and other dependencies.

macOS / Linux (recommended)
```bash
brew install pyenv
pyenv install 3.11.10
pyenv local 3.11.10
```
Windows (recommended)
```bash
winget install pyenv-win
pyenv install 3.11.10
pyenv local 3.11.10
```
After this step, entering the project directory will automatically activate Python 3.11.10 (due to the .python-version file).

4. Create and activate the virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate     # macOS / Linux
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
```
6. Install project dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
7. Select the correct Python interpreter in VS Code

VS Code will not automatically use the new environment.
You must manually select the correct interpreter:

- Open the project in VS Code
- Press Cmd+Shift+P (macOS) or Ctrl+Shift+P
- Select: Python: Select Interpreter
- Choose:
```bash
Python 3.11.10 ('venv')
```

8. Select the correct Jupyter kernel (for the notebook)
```bash
Python 3.11.10 ('venv')
```

9. Creat a .env like this
```bash
# ===== Keys & Model Names =====
GEMINI_API_KEY=
GEMINI_MODEL_NAME="gemini-2.5-flash-lite"

GITHUB_TOKEN=

# ===== Evaluation Behavior =====
EVAL_CONTENT_RETRIES=2
EVAL_CONTENT_BACKOFF=2.0
EVAL_MIN_SECS_BETWEEN_CALLS=3

# ===== OpenRouter Settings =====
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=
OPENROUTER_SITE_URL=https://github.com/jzarazua505/LLM-CRYPTO-BENCH
OPENROUTER_APP_NAME=LLM-CRYPTO-BENCH

# ===== Global Rate Limits =====
# Default for any model not specifically overridden
OPENROUTER_MAX_RPM=10


OPENROUTER_RPM_MODEL_openai_gpt_oss_20b_free=10

# Stronger floors when provider sends headerless 429s
OPENROUTER_429_FLOOR_SECONDS=20
OPENROUTER_429_COOLDOWN_SECONDS=60
```
